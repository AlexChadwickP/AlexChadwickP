✨ I'm a full stack, .NET developer that specializes in writing internal applications to boost teams productivity and comfort.

I love sharing my journey with people and often have coffee chats with new developers looking to get into the technology industry. I also have a blog on my website on which I talk about various technology-related topics, and from time to time write a quick explanation on certain topics.
